            A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of 
            hardened lava and tephra.
            [1] Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile with a summit crater and 
            periodic intervals of explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions,
            although some have collapsed summit craters called calderas. 
            The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and solidifies before spreading far, 
            due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high to intermediate levels of 
            silica 
            (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less viscous mafic magma. 
            [2] Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have traveled as far as 15 km (9 mi).[3]

            Stratovolcanoes are sometimes called composite volcanoes because of their composite stratified structure, 
            built up from sequential outpourings of erupted materials. They are among the most common types of volcanoes, 
            in contrast to the less common shield volcanoes.[4] Two examples of stratovolcanoes famous for catastrophic eruptions are Krakatoa in Indonesia, 
            which erupted in 1883, and Vesuvius in Italy, having erupted in 79; both eruptions claimed thousands of lives. 
            In modern times, Mount St. Helens in Washington State, US, and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines have erupted catastrophically, 
            but with fewer deaths.
